It's like a normal frontend playground, but for [itty.bitty](https://itty.bitty.site)-like web apps. User's apps don't need to be saved on a server, because all the content will be encoded in the url. URLs up to 4000 bytes can be saved on user's account and accessed through short aliases.

Compared to [itty.bitty](https://itty.bitty.site) you can use secure local storage through custom functions. Each project's storage is encapsulated and can't be accessed from other projects.
